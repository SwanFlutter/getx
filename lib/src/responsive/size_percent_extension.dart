/// Extension on `num` to provide responsive font size utilities.

/// This extension provides methods to calculate responsive font sizes
/// based on the screen dimensions. It includes methods to get a responsive
/// font size (`sp`) and a responsive font size with breakpoints (`spWithBreakpoints`).
///
/// Methods:
/// - `double get sp`: Calculates a responsive font size based on the screen
///   dimensions and a base design size (iPhone X). It uses an average of width
///   and height scales for better calculation and limits the scale to prevent
///   extremely large or small fonts.
/// - `double get fs`: Returns the original font size as a double.
/// - `double get spWithBreakpoints`: Calculates a responsive font size based on
///   predefined breakpoints for different screen widths and aspect ratios. This
///   method provides more control over the scaling for different device types.
